# NOTE
This is not supposed to be the final project unless time is critical these days with my normal work and this project need to be fine-tuned with
adding logging, pulling out configurations, adding unit testing and commenting on some methods. Also, I could not manage to understand clearly the last functional requirement adding periodic task to check battery information of drones.
But anyway I tried to add technological knowledge in the programming to demonstrate my experience, knowledge and the approach.

This exact scenario is pretty applicable with kafka streaming to handle flawless events from devices. but need more time to research before moving on.
Application is buildable and runnable using executable jar or docker.
